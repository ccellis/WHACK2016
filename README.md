Welp
=========

It's a Yelp-esque rating system for the Wellesley dining halls, based very directly off of the Flask tutorial outlined [here](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.

You need to install flask using virtualenv in the "Site" directory, then run 'run.py' from that directory. Welp'll start running on localhost.
